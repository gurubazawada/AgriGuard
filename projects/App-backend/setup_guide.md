# üöú AgriGuard Smart Contract Redeployment Guide

## üìã Overview

This guide walks you through redeploying the AgriGuard smart contracts with the new cross-contract communication features that enable automatic payouts when disputes are resolved, and policy processing/deletion capabilities.

## üéØ New Features Added

### Cross-Contract Communication
- **Dispute Resolution ‚Üí Insurance Payout**: When a dispute gets voted on and approved, it automatically triggers payout via the insurance contract
- **Automatic Settlement**: No manual intervention needed - blockchain handles the entire flow

### Policy Lifecycle Management
- **Policy Processing**: Mark policies as processed/deleted after settlement
- **Dispute Processing**: Mark disputes as processed after resolution
- **Statistics Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics for processed items

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Redeployment

### Step 1: Prepare Environment

```bash
# Navigate to the contracts directory
cd /Users/gurubazawada/Desktop/AgriGuard/App/projects/App-contracts

# Ensure you have the latest code
git pull origin main

# Install/update dependencies
poetry install
```

### Step 2: Build Smart Contracts

```bash
# Build both contracts with the new features
algokit project run build

# Verify build artifacts
ls -la smart_contracts/artifacts/
```

### Step 3: Start Local Network

```bash
# Start LocalNet for testing
algokit localnet start

# Wait for network to be ready
sleep 10

# Check network status
algokit localnet status
```

### Step 4: Deploy Insurance Contract

```bash
# Deploy insurance contract first
cd smart_contracts
algokit project deploy localnet --contract insurance

# Note the deployed App ID (e.g., 123456)
# This will be needed for the dispute contract
```

### Step 5: Deploy Dispute Contract

```bash
# Deploy dispute contract
algokit project deploy localnet --contract dispute

# Note the deployed App ID (e.g., 123457)
```

### Step 6: Configure Contract Relationships

```bash
# Get your account address (this will be the admin)
algokit account new --name admin

# Set the insurance contract address in dispute contract
algokit project run setup-contracts --insurance-app-id <INSURANCE_APP_ID> --dispute-app-id <DISPUTE_APP_ID>
```

### Step 7: Set Oracle Account

```bash
# Create oracle account for automated settlements
algokit account new --name oracle

# Set oracle in insurance contract
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/set-oracle \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"oracle_address": "YOUR_ORACLE_ADDRESS"}'

# Link dispute contract to insurance contract
algokit project run link-contracts --dispute-app-id <DISPUTE_APP_ID> --insurance-app-id <INSURANCE_APP_ID>
```

### Step 8: Update Frontend Configuration

```bash
# Update environment variables
cd ../App-frontend

# Edit .env.localnet file
echo "VITE_APP_ID=<INSURANCE_APP_ID>" > .env.localnet
echo "VITE_DISPUTE_APP_ID=<DISPUTE_APP_ID>" >> .env.localnet
echo "VITE_ORACLE_ADDRESS=<ORACLE_ADDRESS>" >> .env.localnet
```

### Step 9: Test Cross-Contract Communication

```bash
# Start backend server
cd ../App-backend
python main.py &

# Test contract connectivity
curl http://localhost:8000/get-oracle

# Test dispute creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/test-dispute-flow \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"policy_id": 1, "test_mode": true}'
```

### Step 10: Frontend Testing

```bash
# Start frontend
cd ../App-frontend
npm run dev

# Test the complete flow:
# 1. Create a policy
# 2. File a claim
# 3. Dispute the claim
# 4. Register as juror
# 5. Vote on dispute
# 6. Verify automatic payout
```

## üîß Manual Contract Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup:

### Insurance Contract Setup

```bash
# 1. Deploy insurance contract
algokit goal app create --creator <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --approval-prog artifacts/insurance/approval.teal \
  --clear-prog artifacts/insurance/clear.teal \
  --global-byteslices 1 \
  --global-ints 1 \
  --local-byteslices 0 \
  --local-ints 0 \
  --app-arg "addr:<ADMIN_ADDRESS>"

# 2. Set oracle account
algokit goal app call --app-id <INSURANCE_APP_ID> \
  --from <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --app-arg "str:set_oracle" \
  --app-arg "addr:<ORACLE_ADDRESS>"
```

### Dispute Contract Setup

```bash
# 1. Deploy dispute contract
algokit goal app create --creator <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --approval-prog artifacts/dispute/approval.teal \
  --clear-prog artifacts/dispute/clear.teal \
  --global-byteslices 2 \
  --global-ints 2 \
  --local-byteslices 1 \
  --local-ints 1 \
  --app-arg "addr:<ADMIN_ADDRESS>"

# 2. Link to insurance contract
algokit goal app call --app-id <DISPUTE_APP_ID> \
  --from <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --app-arg "str:set_insurance_contract" \
  --app-arg "addr:<INSURANCE_APP_ID>"
```

---

## üß™ Testing the New Features

### Test 1: Cross-Contract Communication

```bash
# 1. Create a policy
# 2. Submit a claim
# 3. Dispute the claim (this creates a dispute in dispute contract)
# 4. Register multiple jurors
# 5. Vote on the dispute
# 6. When 7+ votes are cast with majority approval:
#    - Dispute contract automatically calls insurance contract
#    - Insurance contract processes the payout
#    - Funds are transferred to policy holder
```

### Test 2: Policy Processing

```bash
# After settlement, mark policy as processed
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/process-policy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"policy_id": 1}'

# Verify policy is marked as processed
curl http://localhost:8000/get-processed-policies
```

### Test 3: Dispute Processing

```bash
# After dispute resolution, mark dispute as processed
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/process-dispute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"dispute_id": 1}'

# Verify dispute is marked as processed
curl http://localhost:8000/get-processed-disputes
```

## üìä New Contract Methods

### Insurance Contract Additions

```python
# Mark policy as processed/deleted
mark_policy_processed(policy_id: ARC4UInt64) -> ARC4UInt64

# Get processed policies count
get_processed_policies() -> Tuple[ARC4UInt64, ARC4UInt64]
```

### Dispute Contract Additions

```python
# Cross-contract communication
_trigger_insurance_settlement(policy_id, dispute_status) -> None

# Mark dispute as processed
mark_dispute_processed(dispute_id: ARC4UInt64) -> ARC4UInt64

# Trigger policy processing
trigger_policy_processing(policy_id: ARC4UInt64) -> ARC4UInt64
```

## üîê Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Only admin can mark policies/disputes as processed
- Only assigned jurors can vote on specific disputes
- Oracle account validation for automated settlements

### Transaction Fees
- Cross-contract calls include appropriate fee allocation
- Inner transactions handle gas costs efficiently
- Fee optimization for production deployment

### State Management
- Proper validation before state changes
- Event logging for all critical operations
- Comprehensive error handling

---

## üìà Performance Optimizations

### Gas Efficiency
- Inner transactions reduce external calls
- Optimized data structures for Box storage
- Efficient juror assignment algorithms

### Scalability
- Box storage scales with usage
- Parallel dispute processing
- Optimized query methods

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Cross-contract calls failing
```bash
# Check contract addresses are set correctly
curl http://localhost:8000/get-oracle
curl http://localhost:8000/get-insurance-contract
```

**Issue**: Disputes not showing assigned jurors
```bash
# Verify juror registration and dispute creation
curl http://localhost:8000/debug-juror-status
curl http://localhost:8000/debug-dispute-status
```

**Issue**: Payouts not processing
```bash
# Check oracle permissions and contract linkage
curl http://localhost:8000/verify-contract-linkage
```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check contract health
algokit project run health-check

# View contract state
algokit goal app read --app-id <APP_ID> --global

# Check transaction history
algokit indexer lookup transactions --address <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```
